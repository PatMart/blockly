Running Blockly
===============

Blockly can be used on- or off-line with [modern web browsers](http://browsehappy.com/).

Running Blockly Locally
-----------------------
*This option is recommended for people wishing to participate in the [Hour of Code]((http://csedweek.org/) on computers 
that do not have Internet access.*

To run Blockly on your own computer when not connected to the Internet:

1. Download [blockly.zip](https://github.com/google/blockly/raw/master/blockly.zip) while connected to the Internet.
2. Transfer the file to any other computers and unzip it.
3. Open "index.html" in a web browser.

The zip version omits the Graph and Plane apps and the ability to modify Blockly.  If you prefer, you
can install the full distribution from [github](https://github.com/google/blockly) or 
[Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/).


Using the Blockly Demo Server
-----------------------------

If you have access to the Internet and to appspot.com, you can use the 
[Blockly demo server](http://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/index.html).  This will provide you with the
latest version and the ability to save and share links to the programs you create.


Running Blockly on Github
-------------------------
If you have access to the Internet but not appspot.com, you can use the 
[github Blockly server](http://google.github.io/blockly/apps/index.html).
It is currently behind the main Blockly server, but we will be setting up scripts to keep it up-to-date.
